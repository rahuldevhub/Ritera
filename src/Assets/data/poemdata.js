        poem: `I left behind all my belongings,
            Just to reach you with pure love.
            Sorry, babe, I lied---
            It’s just the shovel, a piece to reach my love.

            The sun dips below the horizon,
            No one can see us kiss.
            Sorry, babe,
            For spoiling your lip gloss, I’ll buy a new one for you my love.
            
            I can smell your hair,
            Through the thin air.
            Sorry, babe, for the odour—
            It’s just the sweat; we’ll forget it out of love.
            
            My eyes turned red,
            Since the day you left.
            Sorry, babe, for skipping the meds—
            I’ll rest in your arms now, scratch my head, like you always do, my love.
            
            I’m not crying,
            It’s just the showers.
            Sorry, babe, I lied—
            It’s my tears, and I don’t want to drench you in them, my love.
            
            Do you remember the frogs and bees,
            Back in our garden?
            They sang for you all night, since you left---
            And it was me in the daytime, for you my love.
            
            Fuckin napkins were gone,
            Really gone.
            Sorry, babe, I used your skirt—
            Just to save your picture from the tears of your love.
            
            My show will take place in a while, 
            My agony will be gone in a while. 
            Sorry, babe, 
            I can’t pull the crowd; it’s just you and me, my love. 

            Is it worth it without you, my love?
            I questioned my existence. 
            Sorry, babe, 
            The answer I was looking for—it was you, my love. 

            This drug isn't working, 
            I don’t know why. 
            All I feel is getting closer to you—
            With all my heart, my love. 

            Divine and grace is what I feel, 
            By getting closer every inch, 
            I’m the happiest man in the world, 
            I see you sprinting towards me, 
            I’m gonna drop this California poppies, 
            Pen, paper, and my breathe altogether, On your feet-- 
            As always I loved to stay, 
            Hug me tight, 
            As closer you can, as tighter you can, 
            My hands tremble, I don’t feel my body, 
            Where were you my love, 
            I was worried, 
            Hold my hands, and never___`

        poem: `In the quiet dawn, they set sail,
            Father and daughter, hand in hand,
            Across the border of their homeland,
            Where the sea whispers secrets of serenity.

            No worries weigh their hearts,
            No agony clouds their minds,
            Just the gentle rhythm of the waves,
            And the promise of a peaceful journey.

            And hope dances on the water's edge.

            Their laughter mingles with the breeze,
            A melody of love and trust,
            As they navigate the open sea,
            Bound by an unspoken bond.

            The sun rises, painting the sky,
            With hues of gold and amber light,
            Pushing them towards a new horizon,
            Where peace and tranquility reside.

            In this moment, we are infinite,
            Me and my dad, side by side,
            Sailing through the border of our homeland,
            With hearts unburdened, and spirits light.`

        Beneath the sky's melancholic hue,
        Lie remnants of a summer's scorn,
        Where once lush fields in fervor grew.
        
        The sun now casts a solemn gaze,
        Upon the withered, lifeless ground,
        As whispers of those golden days,
        In nature's silent dirge are found.

        Each brittle stalk, a testament,
        To seasons' cruel and fickle ways,
        Yet in their fading, there's a scent,
        Of hope that springs from autumn's blaze.
        
        A farmer's hands, so rough and worn,
        Cradle dreams within their grasp,
        Through drought and storm, they’re not yet torn,
        With faith that future seeds will clasp.

        The earth remembers every tear,
        Each seed sown in defiance bold,
        In barren times, there's still no fear,
        For life within the soil takes hold.
        
        So let the dead crops tell their tale,
        Of battles fought and lessons learned,
        In every loss, we shall prevail,
        For through the ashes, life’s fire is burned.
